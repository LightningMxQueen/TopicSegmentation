tuesday. minute session semester. level pattern analysis pattern recognition semester stuff. lecture student lecture semester want try. introduce markov field theory point theory. impact. let application know system use markov field money concept use research project. lab use markov field instance segmentation spine segmentation lung thing. project use markov field. idea motivate hide markov model state transition orient graph consider graph orient. edge vertex define dependency structure. want pixel image depend pixel image. draw vertex. draw edge vertex neighborhood structure repeat image pixel neighborhood structure. point mean ray reason define neighborhood. reason define neighborhood. image mean space. space image probability measure space. example. image image marry. marriage photo include set tell event. probability point happen. event probability. need reduce space bit idiot approach mention. approach assume pixel. density break situation use baye remember. justify baye construct feature instance. know gaussian sense. image type independency sense image noise. pixel noise sense image acquire camera device. dependency. dependency question answer look neighborhood. instance order markov mash field way look probability. probability. pixel pixel reduce. probability neighborhood structure illustrate matrix structure write thing comma comma. close bracket matrix indicate neighborhood relationship write pattern recognition. fashion express neighborhood relationship use. problem boundary treat boundary example point value neighborhood value imagine. value estimate number value. histogram think. case let look. bit. quantization. bit quantization mean bit represent pixel value. mean pixel value. pixel value. probability estimate entry. entry entry. entry mean power. pixel estimate. configuration estimate value imagine thing explode. bit quantization camera neighborhood. thing space. want compute probability observe image mean compute product. image pixel image. use density express. formula neighborhood decide. probability observe density point. computation use use probability theory learn. year undergraduate level mean value depend depend neighborhood effect. want compute density consider neighbor. use modeling apply type idea. image image. capture image. mean noise. image measure system measure image observe image. image transform observe image. pixel value value apply classification theory. filter image maximize probability max bayesian segmentation method. want want estimate. want estimate value image. use observe intensity image. situation pattern recognition feature vector intensity value observe image. class number intensity value image. base observation. want estimate image. thing bracket indicate
